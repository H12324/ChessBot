# ChessBot
Ideally, a bot that plays chess or at least that was the original idea.

Now its more like 2 Chess engines being developed simultaneously. A simple GUI based one in python and a faster CLI based C++ version

**Current Progress**

## Python:
Base Game:
- Board Representation (Mailbox) ✓
- Move generation ✓
- Integrating with GUI ✓
- Checkmate/Win conditions
- Advanced Rules
AI Development:
- Test if game is fully functional
- Basic Minimax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Further optimizations
## C++:
- Board Representation (Bitboard)
- Move Generation
- Advanced Moves
- Win Conditions
