# ChessBot
Ideally, a bot that plays chess or at least that was the original idea.

Now its more like 2 Chess engines being developed simultaneously in both python and C++

**Current Progress**

## Python:
Base Game:
- Board Representation (Mailbox) ✓
- Move generation ✓
- Integrating with GUI
- Checkmate/Win conditions
- Advanced Rules

## C++:
- Board Representation (Bitboard)
